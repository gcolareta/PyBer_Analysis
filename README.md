## Summary

- Based on the percentage of drivers and rides for urban, suburban and rural cities, we can conclude that suburban and rural communities are underserved. It would be interesting to explore further these two city types to determine a reason why.
- The average fare price paid in suburband and rural communities is higher than in urban areas. It is recommended to study the distance traveled in these communities compared to urban areas to find new trends.
- Also, it would be helpful to explore times of usage of ride-sharing services in rural and suburban cities, to explore trends between normal business hours, weekends and evenings for example.
